# Election Analysis
### Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has asked for the following tasks, complete the audit of a local congressional election,
including a closer look at county voting.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the % of votes each candidate received 
5. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and percentage of total votes 
for each county in the precinct.
6. Determine the winner of each election

## Election Audit Summary
  - After performing the analysis on this Congressional Election we would like to offer our services for any or all future elections in Colorado.
  we feel our analytic team can even provide more insight for not only the state but for future candidates. 
  - Further insight could be to analyze the percentage of votes each candidate recieved in each county. Obvious that Denver is the key to winning so 
  it would be interesting to see Denver broken down even more.
